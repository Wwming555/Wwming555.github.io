I studied in the School of Automation Science and Engineering of [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) for my undergraduate and graduate studies.
During my graduate studies, I studied and researched with Professor [Kang Wenxiong](https://www.scholat.com/auwxkang).

I am working on gait recognition based on point cloud, virtual tryon, target detection and other related research work. If you are seeking any kind of academic collaboration, please feel free to contact us by email.
