I earned my bachelor’s degree at School of Automation Science and Engineering of [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), and now I'm pursuing a master’s degree at School of Automation Science and Engineering of [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), under the guidance of Prof. [Kang Wenxiong](https://www.scholat.com/auwxkang).


I am working on gait recognition based on point cloud, virtual tryon, target detection and other related research work. 
I'm open to discussing other potential directions. Please feel free to get in touch with me!
